# Joint-Savings-Smart-Contract
This is a Solidity smart contract that accepts two addresses to create a joint savings account.  The smart contract allows the two authorized users to deposit into the joint account and withdraw from that same account.  It will also show who the last person to make a withdraw was as well as the amount of ether that was withdrawn.
